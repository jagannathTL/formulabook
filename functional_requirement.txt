Folder and parameter:
	Each folder contains one or more items.
	It can have one name
	The purpose of the folder is to group related parameters

Parameter:
	There are three type of parameter
	1.Root Parameter
	2.Sub Parameter
	 The purpose of sub parameter is to calculate properties from different meter readings.
	3.Global parameter
	 The purpose of global paremeter is to store physical constants, mathes constants like
	 pi, g, density of water, electron volt, speed of light etc
	 The list of global parameters are added in the settings - 'Globals', when a new test is created by the user.
	4.Meter constants
	 These parameters are stored with measureing instruments.

Search Order:
	The order inwhich the symbols in the formula are searched is
	1.Meter constants
	2.Subparameter
	3.Test
	4.Global variables

Versioning of parameter:
	This feature is moved to release 2.0

Details for a normal parameter:

	Unit:
	Curves Ids(Readonly):Reference to list of curves and its axis 
	Measured:
		IsControlling:
		Measurement Method:
			2 Watt Meter 
			
			If the measurement is direct value use {}
		
			If it is a constant value enter them like 240, 0.5 mV

	Calculated:
		Formula:
			Refers sub parameter, constants like (W1 + W2 ) * Wc. Allows the user to create sub parameters

Sample Parameter and folders for a pump performance test:
	Global Constants:
	These values are shared/private
	It can be real/integer expression interms of other constant

	g
	e

	Specifications:
	Please enter any information related to test item like name plate details, specification, declared values etc.



	Test1:
	Pump performance test
	For various pump discharge measure following parameters and calculate the
	rated total head, rated efficiency.    


	Test Observation:
	sample observation:
	max of param with in the range of param2
	projected value of paramX for param1=10,param2=10 (param1=0, param2=0)
	if any one of the param is 0 then the line is projected perpenticular
	to the given parameter

	param2 @ param1

	Conveting above as formula
	maxCur = max(hd1, hd2)
	obsHd 	= project(decHd, decQty)
	obsQty 	= project(decHd, decQty)
	obsCur =  project(obsQty, 0)
	Each observed parameter refers result parameter
	Result Parameter: Total Head
	Instead of selecting x or y co-ordinate, specify  the parameter itself.


Units:
	Each parameter has unit in which the results of  formula are converted, entered values are converted and displayed.

	The formula default units is SI default unit of the property unless specified

	Each formula can be expressed interms of parameters and its units expected in the formula

	Example

	1.Calculation Discharge

	Discharge -  l * w * h/t   cum/sec 

	l - 40 ft
	w - 30 ft
	h - 20 ft
	t - 30

	here L W h are defined in ft

	t is defined in default unit for time i.e sec

	The discharge is defined in gal/hr

	First the l, w, h are converted into m and sub
	the result is m

	if l or w or h are mentioned in different than default SI unit then they should be
	declared below the formula



	2.Calculation of total head
	HdTot = Hd1  + Z  + HdVel   mWC

	Hd1 = 12.2 Kgf/Cm2
	Z = 10 mWC
	HdVel = v^2/2g mWC

Different views:
	1.Dependent view
		Show the depentant items in the formula. Allows the user to create parameter for it
	2.Hirarchy view
		Show the depentant parameters before the parameters with their unit in the formula
	3.Sub parameter view

	4.Graph view

Major Tasks:
	Formula parsing, Handling 2D informations in formula.
	Global variables
	Mathquill to formula
	Mathquill to symbol

Boundary Conditions:
	Rules for symbol and name:
	Should start with physical property - Dia, Head, No, Velocity
	The subscripted with attributes - Inlet, Total, Poles, Outlet  
	Maximum 4 Main chars + 4 subscript char
	Allowed char : Main symbol start with alpha,OtherPlaces alphanumeric,_
	For name, it is 15 chars, start with alpha and Alphanumeric spaces allowed in other places
	Parameter  symbol and name must be unique across different folder
	The subparameter name can be unique within the parameter.


	Rules for formula
	1.Operations allowed
		Arithmetic operations
		Sqrt, Sqr, power, log, ln, e, trigonometric

	2.Graph operations:
		Project(CurveId, x1, y1, x2, y2) returns list of points intersected by line.
		MaxY(CurveId, range1, range2)

		The system finds error if the x and y is of different property.

Schema:
	Unit : favoritable
	Formula : favoritable => (user, name, latex, share)
	Variable => (user, name,  symbol, unit, formula, lhs, share)
	Favorites=> (user, favoritable_id, favoritable_type)
	AttributeName => (name)
	VariableAttribute => (variable, attribute, value)

	Sample table entries for Discharge calculation
		D_f = (W * L * H)/T_c
		Attribute:
			Method = Collection Tank
		
		D_f => Discharge of fluid = m3.s-1
		W => Width of collection tank = m
		L => Length of collection tank = m
		H => Height of collection = m
		T_c => Time for collection = sec
